Linear Regression with mini batch- Tutorial 4

## How to use this notebook
1. Run the cells to get a bird's eye view of whats going on.
2. Interact with the code to better understand how it works - add cells, plot values, change parameters, etc.
3. (Optional) Replicate Linear Regression code on a blank notebook, without viewing this code. [This is called retrieval practice.](https://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2016/6/23-1)
4. Complete exercises.
